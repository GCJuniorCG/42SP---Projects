# 42SP---Projects
Here are my projects from the 42SP common core.

The projects in the 42 foundation track are divided into 3 phases:
- Phase 1 - libft | get_next_line | ft_printf | born2beroot | so_long | minitalk;
- Phase 2 - push_swap | minishell | philosophers| netpractice | cub3d/minirt;
- Phase 3 - cpp | ft_containers | inception | webserv/ft_irc | ft_transcendence.

It is worth pointing out that I am using github only as a portfolio to present my work and my line of reasoning, I ask and advise all students of 42 spread around the world not to copy my codes (if there is a need) just use them as a research base for their projects.
